    "# Coursework 2: Image segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this coursework you will develop and train a convolutional neural network for brain tumour image segmentation. Please read both the text and the code in this notebook to get an idea what you are expected to implement. Pay attention to the missing code blocks that look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Insert your code ###\n",
    "...\n",
    "### End of your code ###\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete and run the code using `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook` to get the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Export (File | Save and Export Notebook As...) the notebook as a PDF file, which contains your code, results and answers, and upload the PDF file onto [Scientia](https://scientia.doc.ic.ac.uk).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of clicking the Export button, you can also run the following command instead: `jupyter nbconvert coursework.ipynb --to pdf`\n",
    "\n",
    "* If Jupyter complains about some problems in exporting, it is likely that pandoc (https://pandoc.org/installing.html) or latex is not installed, or their paths have not been included. You can install the relevant libraries and retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If Jupyter-lab does not work for you at the end, you can use Google Colab to write the code and export the PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to install Jupyter-Lab (https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and other libraries used in this coursework, such as by running the command:\n",
    "`pip3 install [package_name]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## GPU resource\n",
    "\n",
    "The coursework is developed to be able to run on CPU, as all images have been pre-processed to be 2D and of a smaller size, compared to original 3D volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to save training time, you may want to use GPU. In that case, you can run this notebook on Google Colab. On Google Colab, go to the menu, Runtime - Change runtime type, and select **GPU** as the hardware acceleartor. At the end, please still export everything and submit as a PDF file on Scientia.\n"
